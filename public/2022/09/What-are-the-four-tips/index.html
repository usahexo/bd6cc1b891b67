<li>Start by figuring out what you want</li>
</ol>
<p>Before you can start decluttering, you need to figure out your goals. What do you want to achieve by getting rid of all this stuff? Do you want more space? To feel less overwhelmed? More organized? Write it down and keep it somewhere visible as a reminder.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Take it slow</li>
</ol>
<p>There’s no need to rush through the process, especially if you have a lot of stuff to get through. Break it down into manageable chunks and work on one area at a time. You’ll get there eventually!</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Be ruthless</li>
</ol>
<p>This is definitely the hardest part but it’s also the most important. If something doesn’t bring you joy or doesn’t have a specific purpose, then get rid of it! It’s only going to take up valuable space and time.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Keep it up!</li>
</ol>
<p>Decluttering is not a one-time event, it’s something that needs to be done on a regular basis. Set some rules for yourself (e.g. every month), and make sure to stick to them!</p>
